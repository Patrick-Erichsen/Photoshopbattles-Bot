## Synopsis

This script iterates through a handful of 'hot' threads on r/photoshopbattles and creates an Imgur album of the top 20 images that were posted. The script is hosted on Heroku and runs once a day at midnight.

## Motivation

Browsing r/photoshopbattles threads can be a tedious process, especially on mobile devices. Loading each individual image takes time, and navigating back and forth between Imgur and Reddit on mobile is a hassle. This project alleviates that process by condensing the 20 most upvoted images into a single album, reducing loading time and simplifying the viewing process.
